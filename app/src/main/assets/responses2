If you think you are being followed, try crossing the road to see if the person does too.
Find a nearby shop or business to duck into just in case. Even other pedestrians will help if you ask.
If you are being followed, make a scene by talking loudly which will turn the discomfort on them.
Say loudly and firmly :"I do not know this person and they are harassing me".
