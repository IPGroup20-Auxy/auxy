Use mirrors and windows on cars nearby to see behind you and to keep track of who is around you.
If you are still far from your home, think about moving towards a busier area until danger subsides.
Avoid turning and looking back, as it can make you seem unconfident and vulnerable.
Always remember that it is fine to run away; most assailants will not go through the trouble of following.
Let a friend or family know where you are; call them to let them know you should be home soon.
If you are close to getting to your home, have your keys prepared so that you won't fumble in your bag to find them.
Try to walk briskly and with purpose. If it seems like you know where you're going, assailants will be dissuaded.
If you are currently using headphones for this call; switch to normal speaker phone as it increases your alertness.
