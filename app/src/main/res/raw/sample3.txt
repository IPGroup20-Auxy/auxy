Spit is a good self-defense tool in a pinch. It can also help provide evidence as you are leaving DNA behind.
If someone tries to attack you, target their eyes, throat and groin areas.
Run away as soon as you get the opportunity. If the attacker hesitates or recoils, run to a busier area.
If you get the opportunity to call the police, do it. Even if they will not be there in time, the attacker should leave.
